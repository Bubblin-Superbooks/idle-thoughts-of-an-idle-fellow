<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Yes, sir. What sort of an umbrella would you like?"</p><p>I said I should like one that would keep the rain off, and that would not allow itself to be left behind in a railway carriage.</p><p>"Try an 'automaton,'" said the shopman.</p><p>"What's an 'automaton'?" said I.</p><p>"Oh, it's a beautiful arrangement," replied the man, with a touch of enthusiasm. "It opens and shuts itself."</p><p>I bought one and found that he was quite correct. It did open and shut itself. I had no control over it whatever. When it began to rain, which it did that season every alternate five minutes, I used to try and get the machine to open, but it would not budge; and then I used to stand and struggle with the wretched thing, and shake it, and swear at it, while the rain poured down in torrents.</p></div> </div>
