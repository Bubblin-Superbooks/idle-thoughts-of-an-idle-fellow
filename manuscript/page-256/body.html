<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Dr. Johnson camped cheerfully in them, sleeping soundly&mdash;too soundly sometimes&mdash;upon their trundle-beds, like the sturdy old soldier of fortune that he was, inured to hardship and all careless of himself. Dickens spent his youth among them, Morland his old age&mdash;alas! a drunken, premature old age. Hans Andersen, the fairy king, dreamed his sweet fancies beneath their sloping roofs. Poor, wayward-hearted Collins leaned his head upon their crazy tables; priggish Benjamin Franklin; Savage, the wrong-headed, much troubled when he could afford any softer bed than a doorstep; young Bloomfield, "Bobby" Burns, Hogarth, Watts the engineer&mdash;the roll is endless. Ever since the habitations of men were reared two stories high has the garret been the nursery of genius.</p><p>No one who honors the aristocracy of mind can feel ashamed of acquaintanceship with them. Their damp-stained walls are sacred to the memory of noble names.</p></div> </div>
