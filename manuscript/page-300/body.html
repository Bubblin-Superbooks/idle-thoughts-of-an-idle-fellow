Then when Sir Ghelent saw that of going back there was none, he prayed to good Saint Cuthbert, and setting spurs into his steed rode forward bravely and most joyously. And naught harmed him.</p><p>There is no returning on the road of life. The frail bridge of time on which we tread sinks back into eternity at every step we take. The past is gone from us forever.

Therefore it beseems us as true knights to prick on bravely, not idly weep because we cannot now recall.</p></div> </div>
