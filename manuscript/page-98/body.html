<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After all, vanity is as much a virtue as a vice. It is easy to recite copy-book maxims against its sinfulness, but it is a passion that can move us to good as well as to evil. Ambition is only vanity ennobled. We want to win praise and admiration&mdash;or fame as we prefer to name it&mdash;and so we write great books, and paint grand pictures, and sing sweet songs; and toil with willing hands in study, loom, and laboratory.</p><p>We wish to become rich men, not in order to enjoy ease and comfort&mdash;all that any one man can taste of those may be purchased anywhere for 200 pounds per annum&mdash;but that our houses may be bigger and more gaudily furnished than our neighbors'; that our horses and servants may be more numerous; that we may dress our wives and daughters in absurd but expensive clothes;</p></div> </div>
