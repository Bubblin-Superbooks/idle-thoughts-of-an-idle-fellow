<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It is a most remarkable thing. I sat down with the full intention of writing something clever and original; but for the life of me I can't think of anything clever and original&mdash;at least, not at this moment. The only thing I can think about now is being hard up. I suppose having my hands in my pockets has made me think about this. I always do sit with my hands in my pockets except when I am in the company of my sisters, my cousins, or my aunts; and they kick up such a shindy&mdash;I should say expostulate so eloquently upon the subject&mdash;that I have to give in and take them out&mdash;my hands I mean. The chorus to their objections is that it is not gentlemanly. I am hanged if I can see why.</p></div> </div>
