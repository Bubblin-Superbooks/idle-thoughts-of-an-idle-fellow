This thing the landlady calls a statue. Then there is a "sampler" worked by some idiot related to the family, a picture of the "Huguenots," two or three Scripture texts, and a highly framed and glazed certificate to the effect that the father has been vaccinated, or is an Odd Fellow, or something of that sort.</p><p>You examine these various attractions and then dismally ask what the rent is.</p><p>"That's rather a good deal," you say on hearing the figure.</p></div> </div>
