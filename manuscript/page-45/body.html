<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> how sunny when she smiled! How jealous you were of every one about her! How you hated every man she shook hands with, every woman she kissed&mdash;the maid that did her hair, the boy that cleaned her shoes, the dog she nursed&mdash;though you had to be respectful to the last-named! How you looked forward to seeing her, how stupid you were when you did see her, staring at her without saying a word! How impossible it was for you to go out at any time of the day or night without finding yourself eventually opposite her windows! You hadn't pluck enough to go in, but you hung about the corner and gazed at the outside. Oh, if the house had only caught fire&mdash;it was insured, so it wouldn't have mattered&mdash;and you could have rushed in and saved her at the risk of your life, and have been terribly burned and injured! Anything to serve her. Even in little things that was so sweet.</p></div> </div>
