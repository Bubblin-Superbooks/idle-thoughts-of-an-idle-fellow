<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Do you ever think of those dead hands? You seem so grave and thoughtful sometimes that I almost think you do. Come, you and I and the deep-glowing embers, let us talk together. Tell me in your silent language what you remember of those young days, when you lay on my little mother's lap and her girlish fingers played with your rainbow tresses. Was there never a lad near sometimes&mdash;never a lad who would seize one of those little hands to smother it with kisses, and who would persist in holding it, thereby sadly interfering with the progress of your making? Was not your frail existence often put in jeopardy by this same clumsy, headstrong lad, who would toss you disrespectfully aside that he&mdash;not satisfied with one&mdash;might hold both hands and gaze up into the loved eyes? I can see that lad now through the haze of the flickering twilight.</p></div> </div>
