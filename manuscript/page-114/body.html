Why, they are the deadheads, the drones in the great hive, the street crowds that lounge about, gaping at those who are working.</p><p>And let them not imagine, either&mdash;as they are also fond of doing&mdash;that they are very wise and philosophical and that it is a very artful thing to be contented. It may be true that "a contented mind is happy anywhere," but so is a Jerusalem pony, and the consequence is that both are put anywhere and are treated anyhow. "Oh, you need not bother about him," is what is said; "he is very contented as he is, and it would be a pity to disturb him." And so your contented party is passed over and the discontented man gets his place.</p></div> </div>
