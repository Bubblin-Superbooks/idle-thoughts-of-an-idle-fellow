<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> They toiled and talked and thought; and the great earth rolled around in stillness, not yet laden with trouble and wrong.</p><p>Those days are past now. The quiet childhood of Humanity, spent in the far-off forest glades and by the murmuring rivers, is gone forever; and human life is deepening down to manhood amid tumult, doubt, and hope. Its age of restful peace is past. It has its work to finish and must hasten on. What that work may be&mdash;what this world's share is in the great design&mdash;we know not, though our unconscious hands are helping to accomplish it. Like the tiny coral insect working deep under the dark waters, we strive and struggle each for our own little ends, nor dream of the vast fabric we are building up for God.</p></div> </div>
