<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There is that time, many years ago, when we did not act quite as honorably, quite as uprightly, as we perhaps should have done&mdash;that unfortunate deviation from the path of strict probity we once committed, and in which, more unfortunate still, we were found out&mdash;that act of folly, of meanness, of wrong. Ah, well! we paid the penalty, suffered the maddening hours of vain remorse, the hot agony of shame, the scorn, perhaps, of those we loved. Let us forget. Oh, Father Time, lift with your kindly hands those bitter memories from off our overburdened hearts, for griefs are ever coming to us with the coming hours, and our little strength is only as the day.</p><p>Not that the past should be buried. The music of life would be mute if the chords of memory were snapped asunder.</p></div> </div>
