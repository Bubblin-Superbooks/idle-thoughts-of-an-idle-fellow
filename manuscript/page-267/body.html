<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>They say&mdash;people who ought to be ashamed of themselves do&mdash;that the consciousness of being well dressed imparts a blissfulness to the human heart that religion is powerless to bestow. I am afraid these cynical persons are sometimes correct. I know that when I was a very young man (many, many years ago, as the story-books say) and wanted cheering up, I used to go and dress myself in all my best clothes. If I had been annoyed in any manner&mdash;if my washerwoman had discharged me, for instance; or my blank-verse poem had been returned for the tenth time, with the editor's compliments "and regrets that owing to want of space he is unable to avail himself of kind offer;" or I had been snubbed by the woman I loved as man never loved before&mdash;by the way, it's really extraordinary what a variety of ways of loving there must be. We all do it as it was never done before.</p></div> </div>
