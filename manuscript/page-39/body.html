<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It is well, dear ladies, for us old sinners that you study only books. Did you read mankind, you would know that the lad's shy stammering tells a truer tale than our bold eloquence. A boy's love comes from a full heart; a man's is more often the result of a full stomach. Indeed, a man's sluggish current may not be called love, compared with the rushing fountain that wells up when a boy's heart is struck with the heavenly rod. If you would taste love, drink of the pure stream that youth pours out at your feet. Do not wait till it has become a muddy river before you stoop to catch its waves.</p><p>Or is it that you like its bitter flavor&mdash;that the clear, limpid water is insipid to your palate and that the pollution of its after-course gives it a relish to your lips?</p></div> </div>
