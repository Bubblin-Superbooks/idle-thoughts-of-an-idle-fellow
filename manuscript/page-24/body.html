<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The strong man full of care&mdash;the sick man full of pain&mdash;the little maiden sobbing for her faithless lover&mdash;like children we lay our aching heads on your white bosom, and you gently soothe us off to by-by.</p><p>Our trouble is sore indeed when you turn away and will not comfort us. How long the dawn seems coming when we cannot sleep! Oh! those hideous nights when we toss and turn in fever and pain, when we lie, like living men among the dead, staring out into the dark hours that drift so slowly between us and the light. And oh! those still more hideous nights when we sit by another in pain, when the low fire startles us every now and then with a falling cinder, and the tick of the clock seems a hammer beating out the life that we are watching.</p></div> </div>
