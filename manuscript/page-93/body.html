<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Every one can be got over by flattery. The belted earl&mdash;"belted earl" is the correct phrase, I believe. I don't know what it means, unless it be an earl that wears a belt instead of braces. Some men do. I don't like it myself. You have to keep the thing so tight for it to be of any use, and that is uncomfortable. Anyhow, whatever particular kind of an earl a belted earl may be, he is, I assert, get-overable by flattery; just as every other human being is, from a duchess to a cat's-meat man, from a plow boy to a poet&mdash;and the poet far easier than the plowboy, for butter sinks better into wheaten bread than into oaten cakes.</p></div> </div>
