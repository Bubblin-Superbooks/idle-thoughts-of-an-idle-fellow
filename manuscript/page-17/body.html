<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>But "drinking the waters" was only a small portion of the torture I experienced during that memorable month&mdash;a month which was, without exception, the most miserable I have ever spent. During the best part of it I religiously followed the doctor's mandate and did nothing whatever, except moon about the house and garden and go out for two hours a day in a Bath chair. That did break the monotony to a certain extent. There is more excitement about Bath-chairing&mdash;especially if you are not used to the exhilarating exercise&mdash;than might appear to the casual observer. A sense of danger, such as a mere outsider might not understand, is ever present to the mind of the occupant. He feels convinced every minute that the whole concern is going over, a conviction which becomes especially lively whenever a ditch or a stretch of newly macadamized road comes in sight.</p></div> </div>
