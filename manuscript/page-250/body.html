<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I am getting away, though, I fear, from my "furnished apartments," and I hardly know how to get back. But I have some excuse for my meanderings this time. It is a piece of old furniture that has led me astray, and fancies gather, somehow, round old furniture, like moss around old stones. One's chairs and tables get to be almost part of one's life and to seem like quiet friends. What strange tales the wooden-headed old fellows could tell did they but choose to speak! At what unsuspected comedies and tragedies have they not assisted! What bitter tears have been sobbed into that old sofa cushion! What passionate whisperings the settee must have overheard!</p><p>New furniture has no charms for me compared with old. It is the old things that we love&mdash;the old faces, the old books, the old jokes. New furniture can make a palace, but it takes old furniture to make a home.</p></div> </div>
