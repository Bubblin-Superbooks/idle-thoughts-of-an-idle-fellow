<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Memory is a rare ghost-raiser. Like a haunted house, its walls are ever echoing to unseen feet. Through the broken casements we watch the flitting shadows of the dead, and the saddest shadows of them all are the shadows of our own dead selves.</p><p>Oh, those young bright faces, so full of truth and honor, of pure, good thoughts, of noble longings, how reproachfully they look upon us with their deep, clear eyes!</p><p>I fear they have good cause for their sorrow, poor lads. Lies and cunning and disbelief have crept into our hearts since those preshaving days&mdash;and we meant to be so great and good.</p><p>It is well we cannot see into the future. There are few boys of fourteen who would not feel ashamed of themselves at forty.</p></div> </div>
