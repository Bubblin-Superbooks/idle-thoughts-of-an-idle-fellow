<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We sleek, well-fed folk can hardly realize what feeling hungry is like. We know what it is to have no appetite and not to care for the dainty victuals placed before us, but we do not understand what it means to sicken for food&mdash;to die for bread while others waste it&mdash;to gaze with famished eyes upon coarse fare steaming behind dingy windows, longing for a pen'orth of pea pudding and not having the penny to buy it&mdash;to feel that a crust would be delicious and that a bone would be a banquet.</p><p>Hunger is a luxury to us, a piquant, flavor-giving sauce. It is well worth while to get hungry and thirsty merely to discover how much gratification can be obtained from eating and drinking.</p></div> </div>
